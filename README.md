# AirPollutionPrediction--Using--Machine-Learning

Certainly! Here's a detailed description:

This Python script integrates sensor data with quality control metrics to predict air quality using machine learning algorithms. It begins by loading and preprocessing data from CSV files, merging datasets based on a shared identifier. Exploratory data analysis techniques are then applied to understand the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

Next, the script builds and evaluates multiple machine learning models without explicitly mentioning the algorithms used. It employs cross-validation to assess each model's performance, measuring accuracy and standard deviation. Model comparison is visualized through box plots, aiding in selecting the most effective algorithm for air quality prediction.

Additionally, the script includes a Flask web application component for model deployment. The web app allows users to input sensor readings for weight, humidity, and temperature, generating real-time air quality predictions. This interactive interface enhances accessibility and usability, facilitating air quality monitoring in various environments.

With its comprehensive approach encompassing data preprocessing, model selection, and web deployment, this script serves as a versatile tool for analyzing and predicting air quality, contributing to environmental monitoring and public health efforts.

Python packages required for running the script:

   pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly for reading CSV files and handling data frames.
   
   matplotlib: For data visualization, used to create plots such as box plots and histograms.
   
   scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including model selection, evaluation, and training. This includes modules for model selection, metrics, and various classifiers.
   
   Flask: For building web applications in Python, enabling 

These packages can be installed via pip, a package manager for Python, using the following commands:

         pip install pandas
         
         pip install matplotlib
         
         pip install scikit-learn
         
         pip install Flask

 Once these packages are installed, you should be able to run the Python script successfully.
